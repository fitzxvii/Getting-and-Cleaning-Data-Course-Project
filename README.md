# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
#### This repository is for the submission of Getting and Cleaning Data course project created by Fitz Gerald M. Villegas. This repo has the content on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition using Smartphones dataset.
## Dataset 
  **[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)**
## Files
- **code_book.md:** The code book that identifies the variables, the data, and transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

- **run_analysis.R:** The R script that performs the data preparation and tasked to do the 5 steps desired functions below:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- **IndependentTidyDataSets.txt:** is the exported final tidy data set in .txt format after running the run_analysis.R script.
